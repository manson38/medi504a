The biomedical data,  we are going to use is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) website. You can find this dataset (`diabetes`) in a data folder. The dataset contains information about diabetes of cohort of sample subjects. This dataset arises from a research study of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (Smith et al. 1988). The purpose of the dataset is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. It is based on certain test measurements included in the dataset. Here, the patients are all females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The dataset consists of several medical predictors/features and one target/response variable named as Outcome: 

- `Pregnancies` - Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose` - Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- `BloodPressure` - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness` - Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin` - 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI` - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction` - Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age` - Age (years)
- `Outcome` - Diabetic outcome is given as binary, where “0” refers to norm.




# Task 1:

First import the dataset into the workspace:
```{r load-data}
# import the dataset into the workspace
diab<-read.csv("data/diabetes.csv") # It reads the CSV file and assigns to diab object
head(diab)
```

Please use the code chunk below to perform any modifications to original dataset.
```{r}
diab1 <- diab %>% 
  #changing the Outcome variable to a factor (categorical)
  mutate(Outcome = factor(case_when(Outcome == 1 ~ "Diabetes-Positive",
                                    TRUE ~ "Diabetes-Negative"),
                                    levels = c('Diabetes-Negative', 'Diabetes-Positive'))) %>% 
  # creating a decade based age category variable, using case when to define the boundaries of the categories
  mutate(age_decade = factor(case_when(Age < 20 ~ "10",
                                   Age < 30 ~ "20",
                                   Age < 40 ~ "30",
                                   Age < 50 ~ "40",
                                   Age < 60 ~ "50",
                                   Age < 70 ~ "60",
                                   Age < 80 ~ "70",
                                   Age < 90 ~ "80",
                                   Age < 100 ~ "90",
                                   TRUE ~ "100+"))) 
  
```


Let's confirm the levels of our two new categorical variables... note: only levels with observations appear. 

```{r}
levels(diab1$Outcome)
levels(diab1$age_decade)
```

A quick look at our new dataframe:

```{r}
head(diab1)
```

Great. It contains our new variable, age_decade, and re-named Outcome variable observations. 



Reproduce the following figures using the `diab` dataset:

# Task 2: Apply principles of effective visualizations

This exercise was adapted from emilyriederer [ugliest-ggplot-theme.R](https://gist.github.com/emilyriederer/2bf4f67d7e198f8359b61706c82e42ee) to to demonstrate the wide variety of `ggplot2 theme()` options.

Just as a reminder, refer to the principles of effective visualizations when completing this task.

![](figures/lab2-file_insertimage_0.png)

Let's look at this plot:
```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
# Plot
ggplot(diab1 %>%  filter(Age<50), 
       mapping = aes(x = BloodPressure, y = Pregnancies, col = age_decade)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5) + 
  facet_grid(Outcome ~ age_decade, switch = "y") +
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightyellow"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 30, hjust = 0.25),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, face = "italic", angle = 25),
    
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'lightblue', colour = 'darkred', size = 4),
    panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = "green", size = 2),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "purple", linetype = 2),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    
    axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold.italic", color = "blue"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(family = "mono", face = "bold", size = 20, hjust = 0.25),
    axis.text = element_text(face = "italic", size = 15),
    # note that axis.text options from above are inherited
    axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(angle = 180), 
    
    # generally will want to match w plot background
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "orangered4"), 
    legend.key = element_rect(fill = "orange"),
    legend.direction = "horizontal",
    legend.position = "bottom") +
  
  labs(title = "Number of Times Pregnant vs Blood Pressure",
       subtitle = "this is not a nice plot",
       x = "Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)",
       y = "Number of times Pregnant",
       caption = "ages <50 are shown",
       col = "Renamed Legend") 
```

2.1 Summarize what is the role of arguments `plot.*`,`panel.*`,`axis.*`, and `legend.*`

`plot.*` arguments enable customization of the overall appearance of the plot, outside of the plotting surfaces (not including axis labels). Examples of items that can be customized in this type of argument are the overall background, overall plot title, and plot captions. Customizations include colour, size, orientation, font style, and more. 
*plot.background* - changes the background of the entire plot, not including the plotting surface panels
*plot.title* - allows customization of the overarching plot title dimensions/location
*plot.caption* - allows customization of plot caption (size, orientation, colour, etc.) 

`panel.*` arguments enable customization of the plotting surface panels. Examples of items that can be customized here include the background of the panel(s), the border around the panel(s), and the plotting panel grid lines. Customizations include colour, size/thickness, line types and more. 
*panel.background* - Enables customization of the plotting surface panel background (above, colour was customized to blue)
*panel.border* - customization of the border around the plotting surface panels in the plot (above, border width and colour was customized)
*panel.grid.major.x* - customizing of the major x axis associated grid lines. Note, minor grid line customization is also possible (above, colour and line type was customized)
*panel.grid.minor.y* - enables customizing of the minor y axis associated grid lines. Note, major grid line customization of y axis associated lines is also possible, as above. (in the figure above, minor grid lines were removed)

`axis.*` arguments enable the customization of anything associated with the axes of the plot. This includes axis titles, labels and more by colour, spacing, size, orientation, and more. 
*axis.title.x* -
*axis.title.y* -
*axis.text* -
*axis.text.x.bottom* -

`legend.*` 
*legend.background* -
*legend.key* -
*legend.direction* -
*legend.position* -


2.2 Based on your interpretation of this bad plot, what research question do you think the plot-creators are trying to answer with this plot?

**Research question I think they are trying to answer:** How do diabetes status and age influence the relationship between blood pressure and and in those under 50 years old?


2.3 Using the principles of effective visualization, correct the figure. Comment on the steps you took to improve the plot and explain your choice.

```{r exercise2.3,  fig.height=6, fig.width=10}

    axis.text = element_text(face = "italic", size = 15),
    # note that axis.text options from above are inherited
    axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(angle = 180), 
    
    # generally will want to match w plot background

```

<!-- Add your explanations here -->

Below is a numbered list of the changes I made to this plot. To make these changes, I worked through the code from top to bottom, reflecting on what each argument does whether making a change to such argument would result in a more effective visualization. 

1. Reduce point size to reduce overlap (changed size from 5 to 3 in geom_point).
2. Add transparency to the points to highlight dense areas in the plot (added alpha = 0.5 in geom_point) 
3. Moved Outcome facet labels back to the default (right) side to prevent cluttering of the y-axis scale on the left size (removed switch = "y" from facet_grid)
4. Centered the main plot title and resized its text (changed the plot.title = element_text() arguments from size = 30 to 25 and hjust=0.25 to 0.5)
5. Removed the awkward angle on the plot caption (removed angle argument from plot.caption = element_text())
6. 




# Task 3: Advanced Figure Design

Using `iris` dataset reproduce the following plot: 

![Plot title. ](figures/task3.png)

First, a look at the iris data:

```{r}
head(iris)
```

Let's recreate the plot!

```{r}

# creating plot A
plotA <- iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) + #colour set to species, default colour matches
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) + #remove legend with show.legend = FALSE
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", show.legend = FALSE) + #linear model visualization 
  facet_wrap(. ~ Species) + #facet wrapping on species to divide into 3 plots horizontally
  theme_cowplot() + #setting theme
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "gray"), #customizing background of plot to match
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "gray"), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) #customizing axis label size

# creating plot B
plotB <- iris %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) + #filling based on species
    geom_density(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) + #species fill inherited from above, default colours match example, custom transparency with alpha
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1.25, by = 0.25), expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 1.3)) + #customizing the y axis scale to match with more frequent breaks than default
    theme_cowplot() +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12))

# creating plot C
plotC <- iris %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=Sepal.Width, fill = Species)) + 
    geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1.25, by = 0.25), expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 1.35)) +
    theme_cowplot() +
    theme(legend.justification = c("right", "top"), #legend stays in this one, with position customization to top right
          legend.title = element_text(size = 12), #custom legend title size
          legend.text = element_text(size = 10), #custom legend text size
          axis.title = element_text(size = 12))


### Now, combining the 3 plots using cowplot... this will need to be nested because of the different size plots on each row...

#creating the bottom part of the plot by combining plotB and plotC with plot_grid
bottom <- plot_grid(plotB, plotC, labels = c('B', 'C'), nrow = 1, rel_widths = c(1.5,2)) #rel.width customization to accommodate legend on plotC

#creating final plot with plot_grid using plotA as top and plot named 'bottom' (directly above) as bottom in 1 column. 
answer3 <- plot_grid(plotA, bottom, labels = c('A', ''), ncol = 1) 

answer3

```




# Task 4 (OPTIONAL): Making Ethical Data Decisions 

Note: this exercise is not required, but you can only get up to 95% completing exercises 1-3.

Imagine that during a survey, the patients were asked to answer the question of their ethnicity:

The Canadian Census identifies the following categories in its Census of the Population (see options below). Please indicate how you self-identify (you can select more than one category). This self-identification is not intended as an indication of one’s place of origin, citizenship, language or culture and recognizes that there are differences both between and among subgroups of persons of colour. If you are of mixed-descent, please indicate this by selecting all that apply, rather than using the “other” line unless parts of your self-identification do not appear in this list.

- Indigenous person of Canada (First Nations, Inuit, Métis)
- Indigenous (outside of Canada)
- Arab 
- Black 
- Chinese (including Hong Kong and Macau)
- Filipino
- Japanese
- Korean
- Latin, Central, or South American (e.g. Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian, Mexican) 
- South Asian (e.g. Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, etc.)
- Southeast Asian (e.g. Cambodian, Indonesian, Laotian Vietnamese, etc) 
- West Asian (e.g. Afghan, Iranian, Syrian, etc) 
- White 
- None of the above
- Prefer not to answer

Import the dataset `ethnicity_data.csv` and  examine how "messy" the data input format. 
```{r}
ethnicity <- read.csv("data/ethnicity_data.csv")

ethnicity
```

Imagine you were tasked to present the data for the conference/board meeting to show the ethnic diversity of your patients.

## 4.1 Wrangling practice

First, try to convert the dataset in a more tidy form (For instance, making ethnicity labels shorter: `Chinese (including Hong Kong and Macau)` transformed to `Chinese`). Hint: you can create a new column for each ethnicity, and add value 1 if the person selected that category , and 0 if it was not selected. 
```{r exercise4.1}
# tidying up dataset 

ethnicity %>% separate(Ethnicity, into = c("Indigenous person of Canada (First Nations, Inuit, Métis)",
                                                "Indigenous (outside of Canada)",
                                                "Arab", 
                                                "Black ",
                                                "Chinese (including Hong Kong and Macau)",
                                                "Filipino",
                                                "Japanese",
                                                "Korean",
                                                "Latin, Central, or South American (e.g. Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian, Mexican)",

                                                "West Asian (e.g. Afghan, Iranian, Syrian, etc)", 
                                                "White", 
                                                "None of the above",
                                                "Prefer not to answer"), sep = "/,/") 
                                  


#library(qdapTools)
#mtabulate(strsplit(ethnicity$Ethnicity, "/,/"))

```


```{r}
ethnicity %>% separate(Ethnicity, c("Indigenous person of Canada (First Nations, Inuit, Métis)",
                                    "Indigenous (outside of Canada)",

```




## 4.2 Visualization Practice

Second, Try to create a visual to effectively show the diversity of patients' ethnicity. It can be either table or a figure. This task is not easy, so it is okey that your visual wont be perfect. Please discuss what aspects of your figure still needs improvement and describe or describe how you see the ideal images in this case.
```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
# loaded extra libraries


```


# Submit Document

- knit the document to pdf file.you need to have a TinyTeX  to be able to knit the document:

```
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
- make sure the document is tidy, code chunks has sufficient comments, your writing is clear and has no typos.
